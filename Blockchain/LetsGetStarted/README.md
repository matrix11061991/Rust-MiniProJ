To get started with writing Rust code for blockchain applications, you'll need to install the Rust programming language and its package manager, Cargo. Here's how you can do that:

1. Download and install Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. Open a terminal and verify that Rust is installed by running the command rustc --version
3. Once you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can create a new Rust project using Cargo by running the following command:
```bash
cargo new my_project --bin
```
This will create a new directory called my_project with the following structure:
```bash
my_project
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs
```
The Cargo.toml file is the configuration file for your project, and src/main.rs is the entry point for your Rust code. You can start writing your blockchain code in this file.

To build and run your project, navigate to the my_project directory and run the following command:
```bash
cargo run
```
This will build and run your project. If you want to build your project without running it, you can use the cargo build command.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
